## Getting started

First, install `grunt-cli` and `bower` globally (or not) in order to have the required build tools.

    npm install -g grunt-cli bower

Then fetch the local depedencies.

    npm install
    bower install

Finally, run `grunt` to build the theme’s source files.
`grunt` will watch for changes and re-build the output automatically.

Run `grunt build` for a one time build.  
Run `grunt test` to lint your source files as well.
